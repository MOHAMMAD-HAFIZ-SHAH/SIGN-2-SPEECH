## 🎬 What's Next (Your Tasks)

### 📥 Step 1: Prepare Dataset
- [ ] Download images from Google Drive
- [ ] Create dataset folder structure:
  ```
  dataset/
    A/
      images...
    B/
      images...
    ...
  ```
- [ ] Verify images are accessible
- [ ] Count images per sign (aim for 500+)

### 🧠 Step 2: Train Model
- [ ] Install Python dependencies:
  ```bash
  cd model-training
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- [ ] Run training:
  ```bash
  python train_sign_model.py /path/to/dataset
  ```
- [ ] Wait for training to complete (~30 min)
- [ ] Check validation accuracy (aim for >80%)
- [ ] Verify output files created:
  - [ ] `trained_model/sign_language_model.h5`
  - [ ] `trained_model/tfjs_model/model.json`
  - [ ] `trained_model/model_metadata.json`

### 🚀 Step 3: Deploy Model
- [ ] Copy model to frontend:
  ```bash
  cp -r trained_model/tfjs_model ../frontend/public/models/
  cp trained_model/model_metadata.json ../frontend/public/models/
  ```
- [ ] Verify files in correct location:
  ```bash
  ls ../frontend/public/models/
  # Should show: tfjs_model/ and model_metadata.json
  ```

### 🧪 Step 4: Test Application
- [ ] Start React app:
  ```bash
  cd ../frontend
  npm start
  ```
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Navigate to "Sign to Text" tab
- [ ] Check for "Model loaded" status
- [ ] Click "Start Camera"
- [ ] Grant camera permissions
- [ ] Test with hand signs
- [ ] Verify detection works
- [ ] Check accuracy on different signs

### 🎨 Step 5: Optimize (Optional)
- [ ] Test all trained signs
- [ ] Note which signs have low accuracy
- [ ] Collect more images for problematic signs
- [ ] Retrain with augmented dataset
- [ ] Adjust confidence threshold if needed
- [ ] Fine-tune stabilization parameters

## 📊 Quality Checklist

### Training Quality
- [ ] Validation accuracy >80%
- [ ] No overfitting (train/val gap <10%)
- [ ] Training completed without errors
- [ ] Model files generated successfully
- [ ] All classes present in metadata

### Detection Quality
- [ ] Camera starts smoothly
- [ ] Video feed is clear
- [ ] Model loads without errors
- [ ] Predictions appear in real-time
- [ ] Confidence scores are reasonable (>60%)
- [ ] Text updates correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Stabilization works (no flicker)

### User Experience
- [ ] Loading states are clear
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Instructions are visible
- [ ] Controls are responsive
- [ ] UI is intuitive
- [ ] Performance is smooth

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Checklist

If model doesn't load:
- [ ] Check file paths are correct
- [ ] Verify model files exist
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Ensure training completed successfully
- [ ] Try clearing browser cache

If camera doesn't start:
- [ ] Grant camera permissions
- [ ] Check if another app is using camera
- [ ] Try different browser (Chrome/Firefox)
- [ ] Verify HTTPS or localhost

If accuracy is low:
- [ ] Add more training images (500+ per sign)
- [ ] Improve image quality
- [ ] Balance dataset (equal images per class)
- [ ] Increase training epochs
- [ ] Check for dataset labeling errors

If detection is slow:
- [ ] Close other tabs/apps
- [ ] Increase prediction interval (reduce FPS)
- [ ] Check CPU usage
- [ ] Try smaller model (reduce IMG_SIZE)
